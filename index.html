        <p class="lead">Sri Sri Sri DR.Nirmalanandanath maha swamiji, heading  Sri Adhichunchangiri Mahasamsthana as  its 72nd pontiff. He follows the foot steps outlined by his predecessor with a we and Envision for continuing the good works carried out by math.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">Sri Sri Sri Nirmalanandanatha Mahaswamiji an ardent follower of Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadharanatha Mahaswamiji hails from a Small village in Gubbi Taluk of Tumkur District. After his early schooling he joined Government. Polytechnic college, Tumkur and passed his Diploma with Distinction securing 7th Rank for the State. Later he passed his graduation in Civil Engineering from National Institute of Engineering, Mysore and did his M.Tech in Structural Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai. Mahaswamiji unlike other youngsters had orientation towards spiritual and service activities rather than materialistic happenings. This attracted him to volunteer teaching at the blind school in Archakanahalli, Ramanagar district. He also alike his Guru believes and enjoys in working for the Society, upliftment of the downtrodden and shares similar views to the former. Mahaswamiji took to ascetic renounced life in 1998 and underwent proper training in traditional knowledge systems.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">He has mastered the Devabhasha (divine language) of Sanskrit and has also learnt Advaitha school of philosophy propounded by Adiguru Sri Shankaracharya. His unquenched thirst for knowledge is evident from his attitude in conferences and functions wherein he enjoys listening to the discourses on Vedas and other shastras as a student rather than as a head of one of the glorious Math.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">The present Mahaswamiji before being chosen to succeed the Siddha Simhasana was appointed by the former Mahaswamiji to head the Shaka (branch) Math at  Chikkaballapur. His selfless service and involvement in the activities of the math impacted on the Guru to adopt Sri Nirmalanandanatha Swamiji as his rightful heir and occupy the responsible post of heading Sri Adichunchanagiri Mahasamstana Math. A true leader is one who focuses on the collective progress rather than concentrating on individual gains. The present Mahaswamiji is immensely influenced by the preaching of Swami Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and teachings of Swami Vivekananda. He in addition to advocating the Jnana and Karma path of Sri Sri Sri Dr. Balagangadharanatha Mahaswamiji, fervently believes in integral development through adherence to Raja yoga, the path advocated by Swami Vivekananda.  In pursuance of the same Mahaswamiji has convened the Foundation for Unity of Religious and enlightened Citizens (FUREC) and is actively associated with the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha, confederation of Indian Spiritual movement activities. His writings reflect his revolutionary thoughts of converging all the divergent efforts of the Adichunchangiri Math towards reviving of Sanatana Hindu Dharma and secluding all the myths and superstitious beliefs in the Society which are misleading & diluting the energies of present generations. His Holiness is actively involved in counseling activities and guide the ones who have a strayed and beguiled from the righteous path.  He is the ideal example for present day youth who try to mimic the shallow western culture disregarding our rich values, as a influence of modern education.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="lead">The Swamiji envisages several plans for expanding the activities taken up by his Guru, enlisting a few below as:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Establishment of Medical colleges</li>
          <li>Advocating bio-friendly energy systems</li>
